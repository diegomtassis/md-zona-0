# Zona 0 MD - a port of Zona 0 for Sega Megadrive

### Zona 0

[Zona 0](https://computeremuzone.com/ficha/171/zona-0) was created originally in 1991 by [TopoSoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topo_Soft).


### Mega Drive port

Sega Mega Drive / Genesis port written by diegomtassis using SGDK.

It's currently work in progress.

Zona 0 was a TopoSoft property. TopoSoft dissolved in 1994, hence it is not clear to me who is the owner of the Zona 0 rights. In any case, it's not me, and I assume Zona 0 rights belong to someone. The same applies to all the artwork in this port, which has been extracted directly from the original game. This port is free and is been built without TopoSoft permission.
